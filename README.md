# HMLSL
Proof of motorway safety with an extension of Multi-Lane Spatial Logic as an semantic embedding in Isabelle/HOL 


# Abbreviations
The operators for HMLSL can be written using
the abbreviations defind in the file "abbrev".
The file can be installed by copying it to the
.isabelle/$ISABELLE_VERSION/jedit folder in the
user's home directory.

To activate them, please open the menu "Utilities->Global Options"
and check the "Space bar expands abbrevs" option.

Following the implementation of Benzm√ºller[1], we choose to prefix each
abbreviation with "m". The first-order operators mostly 
follow the conventions in Isabelle, while the HMLSL specific
operators also carry semantically sensible names.

* mor	  : disjunction
* mneg	  : negation
